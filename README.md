Mili's world.execute(me), but it's written in JavaScript. Because Java is a bad language.

(there's like zero change to the actual code whatsoever it's literally just changing `public class` to `class` and `package` to `module.exports`, try not to take this too seriously(except the java part, that language sucks)
